//! This library only exists to have a common structure definition that can be
//! passed from the bootloader to the kernel. This contains any information
//! that the bootloader wants to enlighten the kernel with.
//!
//! This structure also support backwards passing, for the kernel to pass
//! information back to the bootloader. This just means that this structure
//! lives forever and is not deleted or moved by either the bootloader or
//! kernel.
